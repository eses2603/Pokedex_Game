<h1> Pokedex Game-Website </h1>

I've independently designed and coded a responsive Pokedex Game website, and it's ready to explore!

ðŸ”¸ Project Name: Pokedex Game Web Site

ðŸ”¸ Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, React JS

ðŸ”¸ Project Description: This website, which I designed and coded from scratch, works flawlessly on various devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.I would like to share the codes of the Pokemon card game application I developed using React! This project was created to demonstrate basic React components and props usage.
Pokecard Component: Represents each Pokemon card. It shows data such as the name of the card, its type and experience points.
Pokegame Component: Represents a round of the game. This component creates two Pokedex components containing the cards of two randomly selected players.
Pokedex Component: Represents the Pokemon cards the player has. It shows the total experience points and indicates the winning or losing player.
This project can be a great starting point for those who want to develop a simple gaming application using React technology!
